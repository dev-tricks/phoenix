[![lerna](https://img.shields.io/badge/maintained%20with-lerna-cc00ff.svg)](https://lernajs.io/)

This library provides common functionalities used by all platforms.

## Installation

```
npm install && npm run bootstrap
```

That's it!


## Running Tests

1. Single test run `npm run test`
2. Run in watch mode `npm run test:watch` 
3. Run end-to-end test `npm run test:e2e` 
| Keep in mind that these tests are slow as they run against true servers. And therefore, it cannot be guaranteed that all E2E tests always work
